* Usage

** The Layout of Notes

   Since this exporter is derived from the standard html exporter it
   should support all the nice features of org-mode.

   The structure of a note is the same as that of =anki-editor= which is
   itself inspired by =org-drill=. More examples can be found in
   [[./examples.org][examples.org]].

   - An Anki note is an Org entry with a =ANKI_NOTE_TYPE= property.
   - Anki tags can be set in two ways
     1. With "ANKI_TAGS" property, multiple tags are seperated with space
     2. With Org tags [fn:1], this could be turned off if you would like to keep Org tags separated from Anki tags
   - Other necessary information (e.g. deck, note type) of a note is
     put in the property drawer of the entry
     - the =ANKI_DECK= property is retrieved with inheritance so you
       don't have to set it per note. For example you could
       + create a deck entry with this property set and put note
         entries under it;
       + or set it as a global property by inserting ~#+PROPERTY:
         ANKI_DECK YourDeck~ near the top of the file.
   - Child entries of a note entry are fields. More precisely
     - The field name is retrieved from the entry title
     - It is an error if the entry title it not a field name

* Limitations

** Tags between Anki and Org

   Because the set of characters allowed in tags is different between
   Anki and Org, you have to make sure that tags from Anki are
   compatible with Org and tags in Org could be recognized by Anki.

** Working with Anki add-ons

   This package may not work well when you are using certain Anki
   add-ons especially those who extend the builtin Anki note editor to
   automatically fill note field content (e.g. ~Add note id~).

[fn:1] It should be noted that Org only allows letters, numbers, =_=
and =@= in a tag but Anki allows more, so you may have to edit you
Anki tags before they can be used in Org without any surprise.
